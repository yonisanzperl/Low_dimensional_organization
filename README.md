# Low dimensional organization of global brain states of reduced consciousness
Repository containing the codes to reproduce the work


Addtopath contains several functions that are needed in the Auto_hopf.m script that run the Genetic Algorithm to optimise the parameters by simulate coupled Stuart Landau oscillators 

Kick folder contains the script to perform the pertubation with external forcing over the Stuart Landau Oscillators

The VAE folder contains the codes to encoded the modeled functional connectivity from different brain states.
