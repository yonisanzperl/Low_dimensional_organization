# Low dimensional organization of global brain states of reduced consciousness
Repository containing the codes to reproduce the work published in Cell Reports (https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)00502-8.pdf)

The scritps to perform the whole-brain model for different brain state together with the VAE generation based on the modeled functional connectivity are present in here.

Addtopath contains several functions that are needed in the Auto_hopf.m script that run the Genetic Algorithm to optimise the parameters by simulate coupled Stuart Landau oscillators 

Kick folder contains the script to perform the pertubation with external forcing over the Stuart Landau Oscillators

to Figure folder contains the codes to generate the elements of the figures of the work,
and also the trained VAE.
